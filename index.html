        <p>Heres A Thought: Everything we do gives us experience. That experience increases your overall stats when doing other activities.
            The whole point of existing is to execute activities that give you experience. Being smart overall requires good perception and observation of
            anything. For example, when you don't understand something. Then you look around and realize you were missing information or you figured it out yourself.
            That activity of problem solving/critical thinking strengthens with each use. So every day you should ask yourself, how do the pieces connect.
            I was thinking about how people are always at a certain stage in life that other people have gone through. They may already understand how to be a great speaker.
            Compared to someone who is scared of talking so they always avoided it, they are at a further overall skillset mastery level. That person who is a great speaker,
            may partake in various activities besides speaking, but they still get the experience needed to be able to speak in a great manner.
